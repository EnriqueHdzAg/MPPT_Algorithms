## 游늬 Included Scripts
This repository contains all scripts required to reproduce the numerical simulation results presented in the article

| Script | Related Figure(s) | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| `HillClimbing.m` | Fig. 11 (Purple trace) | It allows you to calculate the MPP of a PV system by determining the power differential until they equal zero. This is done by varying the duty cycle. |
| `PerturbObserve.m` | Fig. 11 (Blue trace) | It allows you to calculate the MPP of a PV system by determining the power and voltage differential until they equal zero. This is done by varying the duty cycle. |
| `IncrementalConductance.m` | Fig. 11 (Yellow trace) | It allows you to calculate the MPP of a PV system by determining the instantaneous and incremental conductance until the voltage and current differential is equal to zero. This is done by varying the duty cycle. |
| `ParticleSwarmOptimization.m` | Fig. 11 (Brown trace) | It allows you to calculate the MPP of a PV system by varying the duty cycle from 20% to 80% in 5% increments. The duty cycle at which the highest power magnitude was generated is held fixed until an abrupt change is detected. |
| `PSO_PO.m` | Fig. 11 (Green trace) | It allows you to calculate the MPP of a PV system by varying the duty cycle from 20% to 80% in 10% increments. The duty cycle at which the highest power magnitude was generated is kept as a reference and the P&O algorithm comes into operation to track more accurately. |

## 游늭 Guide to use 

- In order to implement the MPPT algorithm codes, it is necessary to incorporate them within a Simulink "Function block". This block is considered the fundamental component of the control system for a PV system, necessitating its integration with a "PV array" block.
- The inputs of the block corresponding to the MPPT algorithm are equivalent to the voltage between the output terminals and the output current of the PV system. The output of the algorithm block is directly proportional to the duty cycle of the converter switch.
- The converter is equipped with the necessary components to regulate the power output of the PV system and facilitate the transmission of energy to the load. The MPPT algorithm block is designed to modulate the duty cycle of the primary switch within the converter, taking into account the irradiance and the input temperature of the PV system.
